# Roadmap

This document is the authoritative checklist for the first public alpha.
Until every release blocker is complete, do not push release artifacts, publish
container images or Helm charts, or create an alpha tag.

The sections are ordered by dependency. Within a section, implementation may
proceed in parallel where the work does not overlap. Any new correctness,
security, interoperability, or data-loss finding becomes a release blocker and
is fixed before feature work continues.

## 0. Resolve known findings

- [ ] Remove the accidental review sentence from the README attribution section.
- [ ] Make MQTT TLS startup fail closed. An invalid or unreadable certificate,
  key, or CA must never result in a plaintext listener.
- [ ] Reconcile the README TLS/mTLS feature claim with the parked TLS reference
  tests and the missing certificate-rollover behavior.
- [ ] Resolve the MQTT core TODO concerning JetStream domain assignment.
- [ ] Resolve and document the policy for subscriptions to internal MQTT
  subjects.
- [ ] Replace brittle JetStream error-string matching in the QoS 2 path with a
  robust error classification.
- [ ] Decide and test the expected QoS 2 behavior for an unacknowledged PUBLISH
  after UNSUBSCRIBE.

## 1. Settle release decisions

These decisions affect binary behavior, package names, images, charts,
documentation, and release artifacts. Make them before creating those surfaces.

### Product name

- [ ] Decide the product name before renaming packages, images, charts,
  workflows, or release artifacts.

Current recommendation: `mqtt-nats-broker` describes the product more
accurately than `mqtt-nats-bridge`. The process terminates MQTT and owns broker
semantics; it does not merely relay between two independent brokers.
`nats-mqtt-broker` is also accurate but may imply that this is an official NATS
project. Retain `mqtt-nats-bridge` only if continuity outweighs that ambiguity.

### Memory-limit strategy

- [ ] Decide whether to use `github.com/KimMachineGun/automemlimit`.

Current recommendation: use the pinned library with a documented 0.9 ratio and
allow an explicit `GOMEMLIMIT` override. Kubernetes `resourceFieldRef` cannot
multiply the memory limit by 0.9, while implementing Kubernetes quantity
arithmetic in Helm is fragile. Acceptance requires cgroup v1/v2 tests and clear
behavior when no container limit is configured.

## 2. Make the MQTT core maintainable

- [ ] Split `internal/mqtt/mqtt.go` along stable responsibilities: protocol
  parsing, connection lifecycle, sessions, subscriptions, retained messages,
  QoS flows, MQTT 5 properties, JetStream persistence, and transports.
- [ ] Keep behavior unchanged during the split and run the upstream and native
  suites after each extraction.
- [ ] Preserve provenance for code derived from NATS Server through NOTICE and
  concise file or package documentation.
- [ ] Do not preserve file layout merely to keep a line-by-line upstream diff;
  maintainability of this broker is the controlling requirement.

## 3. Add MQTT transports

### TLS and certificate rollover

- [ ] Support MQTT TLS and mutual TLS as tested production listener modes.
- [ ] Reload certificate, private-key, and client-CA changes from projected
  Kubernetes Secrets without restarting the process or pod.
- [ ] Do not require Stakater Reloader or another rollout controller.
- [ ] Replace the active TLS configuration atomically only after the complete
  replacement configuration validates.
- [ ] Keep the last valid configuration active when a projected update is
  incomplete, malformed, or contains a mismatched key.
- [ ] Prove that new handshakes use the replacement certificate while existing
  MQTT connections remain connected.
- [ ] Cover expiry, malformed files, mismatched keys, CA rollover, concurrent
  handshakes, and failed reload recovery in native tests.

### WebSocket

- [ ] Implement MQTT over WebSocket and secure WebSocket.
- [ ] Define listener, path, origin, proxy-header, timeout, and TLS settings.
- [ ] Add native integration tests for MQTT 3.1.1 and 5.0 over WebSocket.
- [ ] Replace or retire the parked upstream WebSocket reference tests once
  equivalent behavior is covered.

## 4. Build the runtime image

- [ ] Build the runtime image `FROM scratch`.
- [ ] Copy the system CA bundle into the runtime image.
- [ ] Run as a numeric non-root user with a read-only root filesystem.
- [ ] Verify outbound TLS connections to NATS, mounted MQTT TLS Secrets,
  health probes, graceful shutdown, and signal handling.
- [ ] Build and smoke-test linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 images in CI.

## 5. Package for Kubernetes

### Kubernetes manifest

- [ ] Replace JSON-like flow mappings and sequences in the example manifest
  with readable block-style YAML.
- [ ] Set the effective Go memory limit to 90 percent of the container memory
  limit.
- [ ] Include secure defaults, probes, resource requests and limits, graceful
  termination, and optional TLS Secret mounts.

### Helm chart

- [ ] Add a production Helm chart for the broker.
- [ ] Include Deployment, Service, TLS mounts, probes, resources, security
  context, autoscaling options, PodDisruptionBudget, and graceful termination.
- [ ] Support an external NATS/JetStream cluster.
- [ ] Add the official NATS chart as an optional dependency.
- [ ] Expose the dependency configuration under `nats:` so users can place
  normal NATS chart values there without translating every field.
- [ ] Add Helm lint, template, install, upgrade, rollback, and optional-NATS
  tests to CI.
- [ ] Package and publish the chart as an OCI artifact in GitHub Container
  Registry only as part of an alpha release.

## 6. Document migration and security

- [ ] Write a migration guide from NATS Server's embedded MQTT listener to this
  standalone broker.
- [ ] Cover listener cutover, DNS or load-balancer changes, expected downtime,
  rollback, and verification.
- [ ] State explicitly whether sessions, retained messages, QoS state, and
  delayed Wills can be migrated. Do not imply persisted-state compatibility
  where none exists.
- [ ] Explain service credentials, anonymous-client defaults, and per-client
  authentication passthrough separately.
- [ ] Provide NATS user/password and JWT/account examples for MQTT
  authentication and publish/subscribe authorization.
- [ ] Document MQTT-topic to NATS-subject mapping and denial of the internal
  `$MQTT.>` namespace.
- [ ] Include Kubernetes Secret and live TLS rollover examples.

## 7. Finish provenance and release documentation

### Remove porting-era terminology

- [ ] Rename the `mqttport_fulltests`, `mqttport_clustertests`,
  `mqttport_wstests`, and `mqttport_tlstests` build tags and CI references.
- [ ] Preferred replacements are `mqtt_upstream_suite`,
  `mqtt_cluster_reference`, `mqtt_websocket_reference`, and
  `mqtt_tls_reference`.
- [ ] Remove `port`, `ported`, and `porting` as project-identity language from
  the README, CI, lint configuration, comments, and documentation.
- [ ] Keep technically necessary networking terms such as listener port,
  `containerPort`, and port numbers.
- [ ] Replace `docs/PORTING.md` before alpha with concise provenance
  documentation covering the MQTT 3.1.1 source, upstream revision, license,
  modifications, and intentional divergence.
- [ ] Keep attribution in NOTICE and the README after removing the porting
  narrative.

### Release documentation

- [ ] Remove the pre-release changelog before the first alpha.
- [ ] Start a changelog with the first published alpha, or generate release
  notes from Git history and pull requests.
- [x] Replace the README's duplicate roadmap with a short link to this file.
- [ ] Make version-controlled files under `docs/` the source of truth for a
  GitHub Wiki.
- [ ] Publish the wiki from CI so it cannot drift from repository docs.
- [ ] Include installation, configuration, architecture, TLS, Helm/Kubernetes,
  authentication and authorization, migration, operations, troubleshooting,
  conformance, and provenance pages.

## Alpha release gate

The first alpha may be tagged only when:

- [ ] All findings and roadmap items above are complete.
- [ ] The full test, race, lint, conformance, Paho, container, and deployment
  gates pass with no unexplained failures or skips.
- [ ] CI is green from a clean checkout on every supported architecture.
- [ ] MQTT 3.1.1 and 5.0 conformance baselines have no unexplained regression.
- [ ] The scratch image and Helm chart install successfully in a clean cluster.
- [ ] TLS rollover, WebSocket, authentication, authorization, migration, backup,
  restore, upgrade, rollback, and shutdown procedures are documented and tested.
- [ ] Release artifacts use the final product name consistently.
